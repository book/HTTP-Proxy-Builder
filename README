HTTP-Proxy-Builder

HTTP::Proxy::Builder is a module designed to help you create proxies in a
"modular" way.

Until now, HTTP::Proxy programs started as a simple one-purpose program,
and quickly grew out of that when one started to "enhance" more and more
web sites. Sometimes not all the features are needed, and commenting out
large sections of a big proxy script is not what one would call flexible.

With HTTP::Proxy::Builder it is now possible to keep proxyies with
different functionalities or aimed a different websites in separate
programs, and to combine them at will using a wrapper program that
aggregates them.

The build_proxy command included in this distribution provides such
a flexible combining proxy.
